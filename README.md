# SearchAIProject
Search Algorithms Project for Artificial Intelligence

The goal of the project was to create search algorithms using DFS, Iterative Deepening DFS, and A* with two custom heuristics. These search algorithms would analyze a generated state tree and determine if a goal state exists by a depth of 10.
